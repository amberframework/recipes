## preact_redux

A React/Redux SPA using the [Preact](https://preactjs.com) library.
Preact is a Fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.
The amber backend serves both html and json.
Create a new amber app with this template with the command;

```
amber new mynewapp -r react/preact_redux
```
Notes:  yarn or npm install issue warnings about unmet dependencies for react.  this
is normal as react is provided by preact via the preact-compat shim.
